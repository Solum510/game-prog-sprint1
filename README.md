Objectives for sprint 1: 
    1. google stag programming and see what it's like
    2. refactor what we worked in class to be less garbage
    3. add a highscores screen maybe


    1. I found this article and read it: https://www.studytonight.com/3d-game-engineering-with-unity/game-development-architecture
    however, it seemed like most of the things that came up when I googled "standard architecture game programming" was out of scope for this class right now.
    
    2. For objective 2, I want to shove basically all of the meaty code into methods, so that my code is easier to manage and understand. 
    That way, when the game state changes, I'm not struggling trying to figure out where stuff starts/ends. 
    This is probably not the proper way to make the code easier to understand and more flexible, but this is the first way that popped into my mind. 

    side comment: having this stuff in multiple files would be nice.
